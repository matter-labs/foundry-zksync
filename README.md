# Foundry with zkSync Era v0.1

This repository provides [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) functionality in Solidity for compiling, deploying, testing, and interacting with smart contracts on **zkSync Era**. 

**What is foundry?**

Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge:** Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast:** Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil:** Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel:** Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

Foundry-zkSync adds:

- **zkForge:** zkSync testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **zkCast:** Swiss army knife for interacting with zkEVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.

Please note that `foundry-zksync` is still in its **alpha** stage. Some features might not be fully supported yet and may not work as intended. However, it is open-sourced, and contributions are welcome!

## üìù Prerequisites

- [Rust Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## üíæ Installation

Each tool within our suite can be installed individually, or you can install the entire suite at once.

### Installing `zkforge` üõ†Ô∏è

Run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path ./crates/zkforge --profile local --force --locked
```

This installs `zkforge` to `~/.cargo/bin`, making it available as an executable.

### Installing `zkcast` üì°

Run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --path ./crates/zkcast --profile local --force --locked
```

This installs `zkcast` to `~/.cargo/bin`, allowing it to be used as an executable.

### Installing the Entire Suite üì¶

To install all the tools in the suite:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Quickstart 

Run:
``` 
zkforge init --template https://github.com/dutterbutter/hello-foundry-zksync
```

Let's check out what zkforge generated for us:

```
$ cd hello-foundry-zksync
$ tree . -d -L 1
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ abis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ broadcast
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test
```

#### Compiling contracts

We can build the project with zkforge zkbuild:
```
$ zkforge zkbuild

## Configuration

### Using `foundry.toml`

Foundry is designed to be very configurable. You can configure Foundry using a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) in the root of your project, or any other parent directory. See [config package](./crates/config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.

Configuration can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. The default profile is named `default` (see ["Default Profile"](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile)).

You can select another profile using the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable. You can also override parts of your configuration using `FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC`.

`zkforge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.

To see your current configuration, run `zkforge config`. To see only basic options (as set with `zkforge init`), run `zkforge config --basic`. This can be used to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `zkforge config --basic > foundry.toml`.

By default `zkforge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `zkforge build`.

### DappTools Compatibility

You can re-use your `.dapprc` environment variables by running `source .dapprc` before using a Foundry tool.

### Additional Configuration

You can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:

-   [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]
-   [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]

## Contributing

See our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Verify arguments

Make sure that:

* You are using zksync specific methods (`zkcreate` not `create`, `zksend` not `send`).
* You set the correct `--rpc-url`.
* You have the proper contract address - the bytecodes in zkSync Era are different to in EVM - so the resulting contracts will be deployed at different addresses.

### 'Method not found' when calling 'send'

If you get errors like `(code: -32601, message: Method not found, data: None)` - you are probably using a `send` method instead of `zksend`.

### 'Could not get solc: Unknown version provided', 'checksum not found'

These errors might show up on the Mac with ARM chip (M1, M2) due to the fact that most recent solc compilers are not auto-downloaded there.

There are 2 workarounds:

 - Use an older compiler by adding `--use 0.8.19` flag to the `zk-build` command.
 - Download the compiler manually and then use the `--offline` mode. (Download the compiler into ~/.svm/VERSION/solc-VERSION -- for example ~/.svm/0.8.20/solc-0.8.20).

You can get the latest compiler version for MacOs AARCH here: https://github.com/ethers-rs/solc-builds/tree/master/macosx/aarch64

You might have to remove the `zkout` directory (that holds the compilation artifacts) and in some rare scenarios also cleanup the installed solc versions (by removing `~/.svm/` directory)

### `solc` versions >0.8.19 are not supported, found 0.8.20

This means that our zksync compiler doesn't support that version of solidity yet.

In such case, please remove the artifacts (by removing `zkout` directory) and re-run with the older version of solidity (`--use 0.8.19`) for example.

You might also have to remove the `~/.svm/0.8.20/solc-0.8.20` file.
