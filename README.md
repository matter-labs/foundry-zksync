### Foundry

- Foundry is a clean-room rewrite of the testing framework [DappTools][dapptools]. None of this would have been possible without the DappHub team's work over the years.
- [Matthias Seitz](https://twitter.com/mattsse_): Created [ethers-solc] (now [foundry-compilers]) which is the backbone of our compilation pipeline, as well as countless contributions to ethers, in particular the `abigen` macros.
- [Rohit Narurkar](https://twitter.com/rohitnarurkar): Created the Rust Solidity version manager [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs) which we use to auto-detect and manage multiple Solidity versions.
- [Brock Elmore](https://twitter.com/brockjelmore): For extending the VM's cheatcodes and implementing [structured call tracing](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/192), a critical feature for debugging smart contract calls.
- All the other [contributors](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/graphs/contributors) to the [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs), [alloy][alloy] & [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) repositories and chatrooms.

### Foundry ZKsync
- [Moonsong Labs](https://moonsonglabs.com/): Implemented [ZKsync crates](./crates/zksync/), and resolved a number of different challenges to enable ZKsync support.
