# Release Process

This document outlines the automated release process for `foundry-zksync` project.
The release process ensures that every change is systematically analyzed, documented, and packaged for distribution.

## Release Process Overview

1. **Triggering the Release Workflow**
    - Every merge to the `main` branch activates a special workflow.
    - This workflow uses the [`release-please` tool](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to analyze the commits.

2. **Commit Analysis and Release Candidate Creation**
    - The `release-please` tool scans for new conventional commits that meet the criteria for triggering a release.
    - If qualifying commits are found, the tool automatically creates a **Release Pull Request (PR)**. This PR includes:
        - An updated changelog detailing the new changes.
        - Updated `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files with the next release version.

3. **Review and Approval**
    - The Release PR must be reviewed and approved by the designated Release Manager.
    - Once approved, the PR is merged when the release is planned.

4. **Creating a New Release**
    - Upon merging the Release PR:
        - The workflow automatically creates a new GitHub tag and release corresponding to the new version.
        - The Release PR is marked as "released" and linked to the newly created release.
        - Merged PRs included in the release are also labeled with `released in version...`.

5. **Generating and Publishing Artifacts**
    - The `release-please` workflow also triggers the `release.yaml` workflow.
    - This workflow generates binary artifacts for the release and attaches them to the GitHub release generated by `release-please`.

6. **Release Completion**
    - With the binary artifacts added, the release is complete and available for distribution.
